# Serial

serial is a C++ library for RS-232 serial communication. It provides basic functionality to open and close ports, read and write data, and manage timeouts across different operating systems.

## Role in this project

This project is a SLAM-based autonomous robot that relies on data from hardware components such as motor controllers and wheel encoders. These devices communicate with the robotâ€™s main computer over serial connections. The serial library is used to establish and manage this communication, ensuring that sensor and actuator data can be exchanged reliably during navigation and mapping.
